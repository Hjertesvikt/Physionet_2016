# Physionet_2016
This is a copy of the most accurate submission to Physionet 2016. The goal of the challenge was to  encourage the development of algorithms to classify heart sound recordings collected from a variety of clinical or nonclinical (such as in-home visits) environments. The aim is to identify, from a single short recording (10-60s) from a single precordial location, whether the subject of the recording should be referred on for an expert diagnosis.
